# Belt

Belt is a CLI tool for starting a new React Native Expo app and will keep your pants secure as you continue development.

Belts are not inherently innovative -- they've been around even longer than pants -- and neither is this tool! Belt creates your app using the absolute latest version [create-expo](https://github.com/expo/expo/tree/main/packages/create-expo). It then layers on the missing pieces, based on the conventions we have found to consistently work for us at thoughtbot, so your pants will be secured tightly from the very beginning.



## Usage

Create a new React Native, Expo app using Belt with:

```
# With NPM
npx create-belt-app

# With Yarn
yarn create belt-app

# With pnpm (experimental)
pnpm create belt-app

# With Bun (experimental)
bunx create-belt-app
```

Or, if you already have an app and want to configure ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, React Native Testing Library, etc, run:

```
# with NPM
npm install --save-dev create-belt-app

# with Yarn
yarn install --dev create-belt-app
```

then run the command you'd like to perform:

```
# eg. add TypeScript to the project
yarn belt typescript

# or, with NPM
npm belt typescript
```
